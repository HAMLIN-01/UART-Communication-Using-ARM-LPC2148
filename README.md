# UART-Communication-Using-ARM-LPC2148
This project demonstrates UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication using the LPC2148 ARM microcontroller. It enables serial data transmission and reception between the microcontroller and a computer or another device. The code is written in Embedded C using Keil uVision IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus.
# Features
Sends and receives data over UART.
Displays received data on a serial terminal (PC or Proteus Virtual Terminal).
Configurable baud rate for different communication speeds.
Can be extended for sensor data transmission, wireless communication, or debugging.
# Tools Used
Microcontroller: LPC2148 (ARM7),
Programming Language: Embedded C,
IDE: Keil uVision,
Simulation Software: Proteus.
# How It Works
The LPC2148 UART module is configured with a specific baud rate.
Data is transmitted and received using serial communication.
The received data is displayed on a serial terminal (e.g., Putty, Tera Term, or Proteus Virtual Terminal).
