# UART-Communication-Using-ARM-LPC2148
This project demonstrates UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication using the LPC2148 ARM microcontroller. It enables serial data transmission and reception between the microcontroller and a computer or another device. The code is written in Embedded C using Keil uVision IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus.
